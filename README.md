## Getting started
---
This template currently only runs on windows with OpenGL 4.6. Support for Linux and older OpenGL versions is planned.

# Quick start guide
---
1. Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/)
2. Create a new repository based on this template
3. Clone the new repository
4. Open ```OpenGL-Boilerplate.sln``` with Visual Studio

---
This creates a fullscreen window (Exit with ESC) and renders a quad with a basic shader. 


# Renaming the project
---
1. Open the project in Visual Studio and rename it
2. Close Visual Studio
3. Rename ALL folders and files that include the original project name (.sln, .vcxproj, etc...)
4. Open the .sln file in an editor and rename the project path
5. Open the project in Visual Studio, fix any reference errors
